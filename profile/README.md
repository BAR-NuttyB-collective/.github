# 🦖 collective NuttyB

A community-driven home for the modern Raptors/Scavengers PvE experience in Beyond All Reason (BAR). 

**What is NuttyB?** NuttyB Raptors is a different flavor from vanilla BAR tailored for a Defense Survival Game experience, allowing a challenging but fair gameplay with better replayability. It features fun & challenging game modes, tweaked units & buildings, special commander upgrades, and all extra units & buildings from the game.

We improve, document, and distribute the evolving "collective NuttyB" configuration, guides, and tooling so that players, developers, and doc writers have a single place to start.

## 🎮 Quickstart for Players

1. Open the Collective NuttyB Configurator: https://bar-nuttyb-collective.github.io/configurator/
2. Select your tweaks and options. The page will generate lobby command blocks for you.
3. Copy each “Part” into the BAR lobby chat as instructed on the page.
4. Start a Raptors or Scavengers game and have fun.
