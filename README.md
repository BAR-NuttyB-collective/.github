# 🦖 collective NuttyB

A community-driven home for the modern Raptors/Scavengers PvE experience in Beyond All Reason (BAR). We improve, document, and distribute the evolving “collective NuttyB” configuration, guides, and tooling so that players, developers, and doc writers have a single place to start.

2. Select your tweaks and options. The page will generate lobby command blocks for you.

## 🎯 Goals of the collective

- Improve the NuttyB Raptors/Scavengers experience together as a collective.
- Provide a one‑stop shop for players and developers: guides, widgets, configurator, and links to everything relevant.
